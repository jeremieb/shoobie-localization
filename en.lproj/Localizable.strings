I do mobile product design by day and by night, I do coding, streaming and podcasting, everything from Amsterdam in the Netherlands, where I’m living with my family. \n
Shoobie is serving two purposes: First, for me to experiment coding and software development and second, I wanted a simple app to follow Atlantic tides when I’m going with my family on the Île de Ré, in France. \n
You can follow must of the development live on my [Twitch channel](https://twitch.tv/monsieurbee). You can also reach me [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jeremieberduck), I’d love to hear about your experience with Shoobie. \n
If you like the app, support indie development and please tell a friend or leave a review on the store!";
